# Twitter Collection Utilities

## Description

This is a set of Python scripts that performs some usual data collection tasks from Twitter. This includes continuos crawling of the tweets of a list of users or getting all the tweets from a user's timeline.

## Scripts

ch.py - gets the historical tweets of a list of users

dedupl.sh - deduplicate a file of tweets

_Usage_:
	./dedupl.sh folder
folder - folder of tweet files that need deduplication (relative to script location)

follow.py - follows a list of users without making twitter suspicious

Follows a list of users from the current account.

_Usage_:
	python follow.py userfile consumerid iter wait
userfile - file with the list of user ids, one/line (default 'user-file')
consumerid - number of consumer (see installation section)
iter - number of batches to split the users into (default 10)
wait - wait period between batches of follow requests (default 3600)

monitor-timeline.py - get and monitor timeline of a user

monitor-users.py - get and monitor timeline of a list of users

oauth.py - use twitter api as with curl

_Usage_:
	python oauth.py url consumerid
Can be ran as standalone script, without using the Twitter python package
url - url address to the Twitter API
consumerid - number of consumer (see installation section)

_Example_:
	python oauth.py https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/home_timeline.json

## Installation

How to install (make the packaging)

**Add the Twitter API Keys (required)**

In order for your scripts to run, you need to authenticate with the Twitter API. This can be done by using the 4 keys Twitter provides you when you register an application. For more information go to https://dev.twitter.com/ To use some scripts (e.g. follow.py) you need to add the read&write access for your application.

You may have multiple consumers, associated with different accounts/applications. You should store these keys in your home directory in a file named .twittertokens The file should contain the 4 keys associated with an application on each line in the following format:
ConsumerKey,ConsumerSecret,AccessToken,AccessSecret

Whenever consumerid is mentioned, it is a integer value k that indicates the credentials on the line k-1 of the file. If not specified, the default consumerid is always 0.

## Bugs

I am currently running continuously all the scripts and hope to have eliminated all the bugs so the scripts are safe to be run without needing to worry about crashing. However, if you encounter any bugs, please tell me. All the scripts were tested under Unix.

## To add

Generalize some functions
